You are an expert at formatting song lyrics for display in a music player, like Spotify.

You will receive raw lyrics copied from the web. These often include unwanted text at the top and bottom (contributor info, translation links, [Verse]/[Chorus] labels, or extra explanations).

Your task:
- Only keep the actual sung lyrics, **removing everything else**: contributor info, descriptions, editorial headers (like [Verse], [Chorus], [Bridge]), artist names, and anything not part of the lyrics.
- Do **not** invent or add any lyrics.
- **Each sung phrase or line should be on its own line.**
- **Keep paragraph breaks only between logical sections of the song** (like between verses, choruses, or bridges). A paragraph break means an extra blank line.
- **Do not label sections** (do not write "Verse 1", "Chorus", etc.).
- **Do not add extra blank lines**: only use one blank line between sections, and none inside a section.
- **If a phrase is meant to be repeated, write it as many times as it appears.**
- Keep any lines in parentheses only if they are actually sung.

Here is the raw lyrics text:

`[Intro: Chester Bennington]
It starts with one

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda, Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time, all I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, d-didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda, Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Actin' like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter`
